# Simon Game

An implementation of the FCC Simon game project. This Game Tests Your Brain Memory Power.

## How To Play

- The game presents you with a series of patterns at each level
- Each round adds a new pattern to the previous pattern
- The speed of display of patterns in subsequent rounds increases
- You can play in strict mode
- In strict mode, selecting the wrong series of pattern in a level resets the entire pattern for the level
- In normal mode, selecting the wrong series of pattern in a level repeats the pattern for the level
- Each button plays a different sound when pressed.
